### Integrating general-purpose software design tools into KBE-development

#### _Project assignment TDT4560_

This repository contains the source code written as part of the project assignment integrating general-purpose software design tools into KBE development, TDT4560, given as part of the Engineering Software Laboratory, at department of Engineering Design and Materials, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

This project was done in collaboration with AkerSolution KBeDesign. The goal of this report was to investigate the possible benefits of using general-purpose software tools as a part of KBE development.

The project focused mainly on two cases. The first case, was the possibility of extending the AML modeling framework, by interfacing with another general purpose language. By finding strategies for doing this, we are able to build a working prototype integration of the AML framework into the Sublime Text 2 editor.

The second part, explored general software tools more freely, as the possibility of building KBE models from the general purpose programming language Python is explored. This strategy gives easy integration with general software tools, and we are able to explore their benefits without the need to integrate the tool into an existing KBE development system.

Finally, the authors concluded that extending a KBE systems with modules form general software tools is beneficial, but enabling the KBE developer to extend the AML modeling framework, would be more efficient if some changes where made to AML.
